            <h1>Dariali Gorge - Caucasian Gates to Antiquity</h1>
            <p class="trip_text">The widely accepted tendency to visit Stepantsminda in the historical location of Khevi
                / Tsanareti is well justified. It is here that the white tapped slopes of the Mkinvari / Kazbeg
                mountains (5054 m a.s.l.) hide many secrets. Among them is one that says that on one of the slopes of
                Mkinvari is to be chained bold hero of ancient legends - Prometheus...</p>
            <p class="trip_text">
                PiN offers several unconventional plans to spend time in the valley of the rapid river Terek. Among
                them, on the list of attractions belonging to a one-day trip and a two / three-day trip with
                accommodation around the famous town of Stepantsminda.
            </p>
            <p class="trip_text">
                Choose a high-altitude trip is for lovers of the paths that among passing landscapes lead straight to
                antiquity. The Dariali tour offer is a combination of walking, car, and also independent peregrination
                in the town of Stepantsminda or the mountain village of Phelshe (accommodation here) and its
                surroundings.
            </p>
            <p class="days">The one-day trip</p>
            <p class="trip_text">
                includes a route from Tbilisi or Tetritsharo - PiN Hostel to the Darial Gorge. During the trip into the
                mountains, we will stop visiting the fortified residence complex Ananuri (17th-18th centuries) by the
                Lake Jinvali. Trip also stops by the Pasanauri viewpoint with a monumental panorama and then, at the
                Jvari Pass. Next step will lead to the Darial Gorge at the height of the Georgian-Russian border point.
                Here, from the first centuries of our era, stands a fortress bearing the Persian name Dar - i - Alan =
                Alans Gate. The current border infrastructure is a kind of continuation of the ancient phenomenon and
                maintaining the significance of the Darial Gorge as a checkpoint at the junction of two countries'
                borders. Since the dawn of time, Dariali has been one of most crucial corridors connecting North the
                South. It was linking the world of Eurasian Great Steppe with the motherland of the Middle Eastern
                civilizations of the Fertile Crescent. It is not surprising then that the empires of the ancient world
                recognized the Darial Pass as indisputably important in maintaining control over a larger territory.
                Roman legions, Byzantine construction engineers, Achamenids, Iranian Alans. Horse mounted nomads well
                known from historical sources: Kimmerians, Scyths, Hunes, Chazars, Mongolians. Parthians, Sassanids,
                pride of Georgian architecture... this great and rapid river of history poured with a bang through a
                small Dariali’s area and was present where you are now... Another attractions is in the valley of the
                stream flowing from the Devdoraki Glacier. On its shore is a small heart-shaped pond (lovers and
                romantics, something for you). Nearby is an abandoned village (16-17 century), Gveleti - eng. Place of
                the Snakes. We will stay here longer. There is a lot to talk about. Nearby archaeologists have
                discovered a cemetery from the late antiquity times. Among the extensive inventory items include a metal
                ring with an inscription in Pahlavi (Middle Iranian) and a Neopersian/ Sassanid coin (c. 529 CE). One of
                the hills includes relics of a fortress dating back to the 11th century. During the invasions of
                Ilhanids, Georgian monarch David VIII (1292-1311) finds shelter in its walls. Nearby, within the
                stream's range, there are two spectacular waterfalls. On the way back to the town of Stepantsminda, we
                will optionally visit the village of Tsdo towering above the depth of the Tereg river valley and the
                intercontinental route S7, the so-called Georgian Military Road. Leaving the Dariali Pass, we will go to
                the hill above the village of Gergeti, where there is a widely known monastery from the 14th century -
                Gergeti Cminda Sameba. The high-mountain panorama is breathtaking... The last attraction of this trip
                will be a walk around the village of Gergeti. Here are the ruins of medieval buildings decorated with
                snake reliefs. The folklore of the Caucasian highlanders use snakes as strong totems, creatures that
                fully take into account the role in the sphere of engravings of protective magic.

                A full-day walking trip deep into the Darial Gorge is planned. The route leads along a picturesque trail
                stretched across parts of the north-eastern slopes of Mount Kazbek. We will move along the paths of
                shepherds, a trail with a high degree of difficulty because it leads into the deep gorges from which the
                exit leads through the steep, grassy slopes of the subalpine meadows. The passage leads through the
                remains of a highland village abandoned in the 19th century. We will also meet fantastic rock forms
                associated with plutonic processes during the glory of the active volcano, which was Mkinvari thousands
                of years ago. On the high halls that leads the trail there are also enigmatic structures that may be
                megalithic objects from the Bronze Age. Finally, we will reach the highlands towering over the ancient
                village of Tsdo. From here, there are an epic views of the Mkinvari Mountain and the Darial Gorge, high
                rock crags or the Georgian-Russian border. The descent leads to the village of Tsdo where we visit the
                peculiarities of local architecture. We return through Stepantsmida to the accommodation base. Along the
                way, a possible visit to the village of Sioni where lies an extremely interesting complex of religious
                buildings (6-10 CE) and a monumental stone defensive tower (10th century?). Accomodation: Private

                PiN Hostel. The valley is famous for the picturesque gorge of the river, bubbling mineral water and a
                series of abandoned medieval highlander villages. Stone buildings scattered in the valley abound in
                enigmatic pictograms carved on the walls ... In authors opinion, most interesting of the objects on the
                list, is the barrow tapped with stone carved stell in the well hidden village of Mna. Next, we will go
                back. In the meantime we will stop at the Jvarai Pass, a Pasanauri viewpoint with a monumental panorama.
